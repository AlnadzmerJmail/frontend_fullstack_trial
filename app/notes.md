Built a Fullstack customer portal app using Next.js and Express.js with ServiceM8 integration
that allows users to see bookings and its details including attachment files.

It was challenging for me because it's my first time to hear about ServiceM8, and I just found few resources online.
It almost consumed my time about trying to work on the url to fetch the job data that I create in their app.

I just made it simple and unable to make the login and messaging working.

AI assisted me so much but the more I relied on them the more I consumed time at least in ServiceM8 integration, but in writing code
I think it's expected that they can write fast.

To run the project in local development, just clone the repo and it also requires node version 20+.
